My contribution to the (Programming) Language Shootout at our company softwareinmotion. 
It's my first Clojure program.

The idea came from from an event at our company called Language Shootout. At a
Language Shootout event every participant may present his favorite programming language 
and shows how it is used to solve a predefined task and explain why he/she thinks the
language is the 'best'.

It's intended to show the pure language without the use of libraries as well as
showing the typical style of the language.

The task description can be found in the task-description.txt file (in german)
and sample test data can be found in the people.data file.
The data is visualized in people.png.

These are other solutions of my awesome colleagues:
